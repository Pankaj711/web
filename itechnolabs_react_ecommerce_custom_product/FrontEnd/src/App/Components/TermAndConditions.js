                    <b>29. Entire Agreement</b>
                    <br />
                    These Terms and Conditions set forth the entire
                    understanding and agreement between you and Vox Catalog
                    concerning the subject matter herein and supersede all prior
                    or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether
                    electronic, oral or written concerning the Site. A printed
                    version of these Terms and Conditions and any notice given
                    in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or
                    administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these
                    Terms and Conditions to the same extent and subject to the
                    same conditions as other business documents and records
                    originally generated and maintained in printed form. Any
                    rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. You may
                    not assign the Terms and Conditions, or assign, transfer or
                    sublicense your rights therein. A failure to act concerning
                    a breach by you or others does not waive Vox Catalog's right
                    to act concerning subsequent or similar breaches.

                    <b>30. Term and Termination</b>
                    <br />
                    This agreement becomes effective the date that you first
                    access the Site and remains effective until it is terminated
                    consistent with its terms. Violations of this agreement may
                    result in the immediate termination of this agreement and
                    denials or terminations of your access to the Site. Such
                    restrictions may be temporary or permanent. Upon
                    termination, your right to use this Site shall be revoked.
                    All disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnities, and
                    rights of ownership and licenses to Vox Catalog shall
                    survive any termination.
